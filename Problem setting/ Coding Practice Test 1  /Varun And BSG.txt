			Varun And Binary String Generation

Varun has a task to generate k consecutive 0's.

Varun has a function that generates random binary bit('1' or '0') and a string 'S' which is initially empty.After generating the bit he append it to the end of string he has.
Varun is running late for a party help him by telling him the expected length of a string when it will have K consecutive) 0's.

so he can plan his day accordingly.

Note : function have equal probability of generating '1' or '0' 

eg.. 
k=2,s=''
function generates 0,s='0'
function generates 1,s='01'
function generates 1,s='011'
function generates 0,s='0110'
function generates 0,s='01100'        
Varun have achieved 2 consecutive 0's so process stops

Answer can be large so print it mod 998,244,353 .

constraints:
	1<=t<=10**5
	1<=k<=10**18 for 50% of the testcases 
	1<=k<=10**4  for 50% of the testcases

Input :
first line contains t, number of test cases 
each test case has single line K, number of consecutive 0's required to win. 

output :
for each test case print a single line containing expected length of string when it will have k consecutive 0's.  

example:
2
1
23434

output :
2
363364850
