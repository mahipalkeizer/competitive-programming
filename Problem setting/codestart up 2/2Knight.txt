you have two rooks at position (a,b) and (x,y) print "YES" if one rook can attack other in no more than 2 moves or else print 'NO'  .


contraint :
	1<=test cases<=10**4
	1<=a,b,c,d<=8

input :
	first line contain number of test cases
	each test case has one line  containing a,b,x,y 

output :
	'YES' if one can attack other in no more than 2 moves else 'NO'  

example :
input 
2
1 1 4 4
1 1 1 2
output :
'YES'
'NO'

first case:
(1,1)->(3,2)->(4,4)
