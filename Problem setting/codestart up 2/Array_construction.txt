def score(Arr,Brr,N):
	sum=0
	for i in range(N):
		sum+=(Arr[i]+Brr[i])%2
	return sum 


you are given two numbers N,K
find the number of ways to construct two Arrays Arr,Brr of length N 
such that ,
1) 0<=i<n ,0<=Arr[i],Brr[i]<=1
2) score (Arr,Brr,N) is K

Constrains :
1<=test cases<10**4
1<=n<10**5
0<=K<min(100,n)


Input :
first line contain number of test cases 
each test case has one line containing space separated n,k

Output :
for each test case print the number of ways to construct Arr,Brr such that their score is K ,answer can be big print under Modulo 10**9+7

example :
input :
3
1 1
5 4
10 3

output:
2
160
122880
